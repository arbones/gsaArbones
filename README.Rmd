The `gsaArbones` package provides a comprehensive suite of tools for performing gene-set analysis (GSA) using Fisher's combined probability test. This statistical approach allows researchers to assess the collective evidence of association between a set of genes and a phenotype, leveraging p-values from individual gene association studies. By combining p-values, `gsaArbones` helps to identify gene sets that are significantly associated with the phenotype of interest, offering insights into the underlying biological mechanisms.
