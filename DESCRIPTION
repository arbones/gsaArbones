Description: Consider a set of k independent tests, each of these to test a certain null hypothesis H0|i, i = {1, 2, . . . , k}. For each test, a significance level Pi, i.e., a p-value, is obtained. All these p-values can be combined into a joint test whether there is a global effect, i.e., if a global null hypothesis H0 can be rejected. Gene-set analysis (GSA) algorithms allow to assess the overall evidence of association of a set of genes with a phenotype by combining marginal pvalues of a set of genetic variants (SNPs).
